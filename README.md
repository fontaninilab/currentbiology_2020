Figure2_PCAtrajectory_Distance.m was use to construct the trajectory of population activity in PCA space (Figure2).

Figure2_PopulationDecoding.m was used to calculate the classification accuracy and construct confusion matrices based on population activity. The population decoding analysis was relied on the neural decoding toolbox:http://www.readout.info/. 

Figure3_DirectionIndex_TasteSelectivity.m was used to calculate the direction index for each single unit and infer the statistical significance. Moreover it was also used to analyze the taste selectivity.

Figure3_PopulationDecoding_correctError.m was used to calculate the accuracy for classifying correct and error trials. It was also relied on the neural decoding toolbox:http://www.readout.info/. 

In addition, boundedline.m https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27485-boundedline-m and distinguishable_colors.m https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29702-generate-maximally-perceptually-distinct-colors were used for plotting.
